# Customer Churn 

This project consists in implementing a machine learning model to predict customer churn of telecom company.Actually , ‘Teleco-customer-churn’ data set is  published online with public access for learning purposes.

- Out of 29 features present in dataset,  we've selected 15 features after the data preparation phase based on Features correlation and features variances.

- Used 74/26 train/test split, SMOT for oversampling and Robust Scaler for scaling.

- We Tried different classification models : SVM , XGboost, Logistic Regression , KNN ,Naive Bayes , Decision Tree , Random Forest and Vote Ensemble Learning
**XGboost** prediction gave us around 87% accuracy for customer churn prediction and that has still scope for better prediction after optimization.

### As a part of customer retention program, this model can help management make correct decisions on their future plans.
